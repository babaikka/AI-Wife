# Amber ‚Äî Your new wife. Live with it now =D

Amber is a lightweight local chat companion that uses the [OpenAI Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation) for conversation.  
It‚Äôs designed to be **short, witty, sarcastic, and fun** ‚Äî more like a real friend than a corporate assistant.

> ‚ö°Ô∏è Built and tested on Arch Linux, but works anywhere with Python 3.10+.
